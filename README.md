# Git Repo Monitor

Git Repo Monitor is a tool for checking and updating multiple Git repositories.
With this tool, you can check all of your repositories for updates and pull all changes with the press of a single button.
You also have the option to scan your PC for existing Git repositories.

Git Repo Monitor allows for storing HTTPS and SSL login credentials for remote Git providers (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, ...).
Stored credentials are encrypted using a master password and can be stored on an external storage device (e.g. USB stick) for maximum security.
